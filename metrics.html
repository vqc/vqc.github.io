<p>A focus for these metrics is on the parts of the process that are impacted by things the legal team can influence as opposed to things that are influenced by other parts of the process. </p>
<p>For instance, it may not be too useful, from the legal team&#39;s perspective, to consider the time it takes to go from workflow launch to a signed deal. Very often the signature process is something that is influenced by the sales team and the counterparty, and it can be the case that the legal team has completed the final version of the document, and signature will take another 2 weeks because of a process issue on the counterparty side.</p>
