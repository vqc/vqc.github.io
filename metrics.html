<h1 id="metrics-for-sales-side-commercial-contracting-teams">Metrics for Sales-side Commercial Contracting Teams</h1>
<p>A look into metrics that are useful for commercial contracting teams that support enterprise sales teams. Collectively, these metrics are useful for finding opportunities to improve internal processes, ensuring a sane work environment for your team members, and providing context and support for increasing team resources.</p>
<p>The metrics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual Metrics</li>
<li>Workflows Assigned QTD Per Person</li>
<li>Workflows Active Last 30 Days Per Person</li>
<li>Time Off Days Over Rolling 6-Month Period Per Person</li>
<li>Team Metrics</li>
<li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : $ Legal FTE</li>
<li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : # Legal FTE</li>
<li>Ratio # Workflows : # Legal FTE</li>
<li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : Workflow</li>
<li>Deal Metrics</li>
<li>Drafts Per Workflow</li>
<li>Significant Drafts Per Workflow</li>
<li>Median Days Between Drafts Per Workflow</li>
<li>Time Between First and Last Negotiated Draft Per Workflow</li>
<li>Time Per Deal Attributed to Legal, Business, or Counterparty</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the data for these metrics is not the most straightforward and, in personal experience, requires pulling information from finance and sales operations and writing a good amount of custom code and wrangling spreadsheets. I’ve also yet to see good benchmarking.</p>
<h2 id="individual-metrics">Individual Metrics</h2>
<p>The goal of this set of metrics is to get an overall sense of work distribution among the team and permit for proactive allocation / reallocation of work. </p>
<p>The inclusion of the “days off” metric is to ensure that team members are getting the breaks they deserve. It is a very common phenomena for lawyers, especially US-based lawyers, to take too little time off. This leads to burnout. Burnout is bad for humans. And burned out humans are bad for teams.</p>

<p>(to see whether deal sizes are changing)</p>
<h2 id="deal-metrics">Deal Metrics</h2>
<p>A focus for these metrics is on the parts of the deal process that can be influenced by the legal team. </p>
<p>For instance, it may not be too useful, from the legal team&#39;s perspective, to consider the time it takes to go from workflow launch to a signed deal. Very often the signature process is something that is influenced by the sales team and the counterparty, and it can be the case that the legal team has completed the final version of the document, and signature will take another two weeks because of a process issue on the counterparty side.</p>
<h3 id="drafts-per-workflow">Drafts Per Workflow</h3>
<p>WIP</p>
<p>How many drafts does it take to get to a signable version of the agreement? The theoretical minimum is 1 draft, e.g. the buyer signs the first draft provided by the seller. In practice, this is impossible as </p>
<p>This number should generally trend down over time.</p>
<p>Drive this number down by ensuring that the first draft is commercially accurate.</p>
<p>Automate the inclusion of commonly needed terms.</p>
