      <h1>Metrics for Sales-side Commercial Contracting Teams</h1>
      <p>A look into metrics that are useful for commercial contracting teams that support enterprise sales teams.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these metrics are useful for finding opportunities to improve internal processes, ensuring a sane work environment for your team members, and providing context and support for increasing team resources.</p>
      <p>The metrics are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Individual Metrics
      <ul>
      <li>Workflows Assigned QTD Per Person</li>
      <li>Workflows Active Last 30 Days Per Person</li>
      <li>Time Off Over Rolling 6-Month Period Per Person</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Team Metrics
      <ul>
      <li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : $ Legal FTE</li>
      <li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : # Legal FTE</li>
      <li>Ratio # Workflows : # Legal FTE</li>
      <li>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : # Workflow</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Deal Metrics
      <ul>
      <li>Drafts Per Workflow</li>
      <li>Significant Drafts Per Workflow</li>
      <li>Median Days Between Drafts Per Workflow</li>
      <li>Time Between First and Last Negotiated Draft Per Workflow</li>
      <li>Time Per Deal Attributed to Legal, Business, or Counterparty</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Actually getting the data and setting up the systems for measuring these metrics is surprisingly difficult. Things like deal size, headcount costs, and number of drafts per deal tend to live on separate systems owned by separate teams. And, in personal experience, pulling everything together ends up requiring a good amount of custom code and wrangling spreadsheets.</p>
      <p>Good benchmarking doesn’t seem to exist either. One reason may simply be the difficulty of actually getting the numbers. Another may be the specifics of each business. Things like average deal size, market segment, and buyer profile might all impact these metrics, which could make it difficult to compare across companies.</p>
      <p>Metrics get gamed. A few of the metrics here work together to disincentivize (or try to disincentivize) gaming. For instance, reducing the number of drafts that are generated per workflow might incentivize team members to hold onto drafts and not upload them into the workflow management system. The median days between drafts metric would hopefully counteract this by incentivizing the reduction of time between drafts.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is useful to identify floors and ceilings to these metrics, beyond which it may be unreasonable or un-useful to find additional improvement. At that point in the team lifecycle, it might be time to find different metrics.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the  goal here is to find ways to improve the system, not to micromanage.</p>
      <h2>Individual Metrics</h2>
      <p>The goal of this set of metrics is to get an overall sense of work distribution among the team and permit for proactive allocation / reallocation of work.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of the “days off” metric is to ensure that team members are getting the breaks they deserve. It is a very common phenomena for lawyers, especially US-based lawyers, to take too little time off. This leads to burnout. Burnout is bad for humans. And burned out humans are bad for teams.</p>
      <p>The metrics here don’t account for how complex each workflow is.</p>
      <h3>Workflows Assigned QTD Per Person</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>Goal here is to get visibility into how new deals are getting assigned.</p>
      <h3>Workflows Active Last 30 Days Per Person</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>Goal here is to get visibility into</p>
      <h3>Time Off Over Rolling 6-Month Period Per Person</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>The goal here is to ensure that people are taking enough time off for themselves.</p>
      <h2>Team Metrics</h2>
      <h3>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : $ Legal FTE</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <h3>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : # Legal FTE</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>Early on might rely on a # Sales FTE : # Legal FTE instead of a $ ratio. But over time.</p>
      <h3>Ratio # Workflows : # Legal FTE</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <h3>Ratio $ Negotiated ACV : # Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>(to see whether deal sizes are changing)</p>
      <h2>Deal Metrics</h2>
      <p>A focus for these metrics is on the parts of the deal process that can be influenced by the legal team.</p>
      <p>For instance, it may not be too useful, from the legal team's perspective, to consider the time it takes to go from workflow launch to a signed deal. Very often the signature process is something that is influenced by the sales team and the counterparty, and it can be the case that the legal team has completed the final version of the document, and signature will take another two weeks because of a process issue on the counterparty side.</p>
      <h3>Drafts Per Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <p>How many drafts does it take to get to a signable version of the agreement? The theoretical minimum is 1 draft, e.g. the buyer signs the first draft provided by the seller. In practice, this is impossible as</p>
      <p>This number should generally trend down over time.</p>
      <p>Drive this number down by ensuring that the first draft is commercially accurate.</p>
      <p>Automate the inclusion of commonly needed terms.</p>
      <h3>Significant Drafts Per Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <h3>Median Days Between Drafts Per Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <h3>Time Between First and Last Negotiated Draft Per Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
      <h3>Time Per Deal Attributed to Legal, Business, or Counterparty Per Workflow</h3>
      <p>WIP</p>
